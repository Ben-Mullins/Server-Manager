# Server Manager
### Weber State CS 4450

#### <u>*The Purpose*</u>
The purpose of the Server Manager project is to provide Weber State students a simple way to host their web applications on a publicly accessible server. Weber state has set up the subdomain [csprojects.weber.edu](http://csprojects.weber.edu) to accomplish this purpose, and allocated us a Linux VM to do so.
